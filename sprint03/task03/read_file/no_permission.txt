LEGEND

ENCYCLOPEDIA SALESMAN: Burglar! [rings again] Burglar!
"[woman appears at other side of door]"
WOMAN: Yes?
ENCYCLOPEDIA SALESMAN: Burglar, madam.
WOMAN: What do you want?
ENCYCLOPEDIA SALESMAN: I want to come in and steal a few things, madam.
WOMAN: Are you an encyclopaedia salesman?
ENCYCLOPEDIA SALESMAN: No madam, I'm a burglar, I burgle people.
WOMAN: I think you're an encyclopaedia salesman.
ENCYCLOPEDIA SALESMAN: Oh I'm not, open the door, let me in please.
WOMAN: If I let you in, you'll sell me encyclopedias.
ENCYCLOPEDIA SALESMAN: I won't, madam. I just want to come in and ransack the ﬂat. Honestly.
WOMAN: Promise? No encyclopedias?
ENCYCLOPEDIA SALESMAN: None at all.
WOMAN: All right. "[she opens door]" You'd better come in then.
ENCYCLOPEDIA SALESMAN: Mind you, I don't know whether you've really considered the advantages of owning a really ﬁne set of modern encyclopedias...
You know, they can really do you wonders. --

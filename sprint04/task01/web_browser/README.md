DESCRIPTION

Create a script that does the following:

     • takes a YouTube link as a command-line argument
       (if more than one argument is given, just use the ﬁrst one and ignore the rest)

     • validates the link in the following way:

         – same validation rules as in the task Task 00 > Read URL

         – the link must be a YouTube link (the domain name must be 'youtube')

     • uses the method webbrowser.open() to open the browser and play the YouTube video at the URL
 

All actions must be logged as messages printed to the default stdout or stderr (depending on the message).
Use the module you've created earlier.

Use the webbrowser module.

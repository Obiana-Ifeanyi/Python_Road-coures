LEGEND

The wise Sir Bedevere was the ﬁrst to join King Arthur's knights,
but other illustrious names were soon to follow: Sir Lancelot the Brave; Sir Galahad the Pure; 
and Sir Robin the Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor,
who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol and 
who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill; and the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-ﬁlm. 
Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries, the Knights of the Round Table.

DESCRIPTION

In this task you will have to edit an existing script in such a way that, when imported,
it generates a certain output. 

Take the script s05t04_inheritance_gadgets.py from the resources, and edit the classes within it. 
You will have to add inheritance to the deﬁned classes and make the methods work in the expected way. 
In each class you're allowed to edit the class deﬁnition line, and the contents of the methods. 
Don't add/remove methods or classes. Follow directions inside the script on what can be edited. 

If everything is correct, the s05t04_inheritance_main.py script must produce output as shown in the CONSOLE VIEW. 
Don't forget to rename s05t04_inheritance_gadgets.py to gadgets.py.
